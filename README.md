<b> Audio Watermarking </b>
<p>
Watermarking is the process of embedding information into a signal (e.g. audio, video or pictures) 
in a way that is difficult to remove. If the signal is copied, then the information is also carried in the 
copy. Watermarking has become increasingly important to enable copyright protection and 
ownership verification. An audio watermark is a unique electronic identifier embedded in an audio 
signal, typically used to identify ownership of copyright. It is similar to a watermark on a 
photograph.  
  
  In audio watermarking embedding firstly, the audio convert signal was divided evenly, the audio 
segments were selected from the divided audio, then by doing the DWT and DCT embedded the 
watermark to the low frequency coefficients of those audio segments which were selected. 
Watermark is a binary image which was transformed using Arnold transformations. A random 
private key is used during watermark embedding for more security. Finally, all of the audio 
segments were regrouped. Experimental results demonstrate that the watermark is robust to 
common operations of digital audio signal processing, such as white Gaussian noise addition, 
compression and low pass filtering. To evaluate the performance of the proposed audio 
watermarking method, subjective and objective quality tests including Bit Error Rate (BER) and 
Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) are calculated.
